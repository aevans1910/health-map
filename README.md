## HEALTH MAP - Health care in your back pocket

This code represents the skateboard/first version of Health Map, a virtual health website
that enables busy individuals manage their health care wherever they are. 

## Motivation

I want to make health care more accesible to individuals. People shouldn't have to take time off their work to go to an overcrowded space to wait in line for hours for their health services. I therefore wanted to make a product that enabled individuals to connect with their providers virtualy. 

## Where I am now

At the moment, I am still unable to fulfil all of my wishes for Health Map, it is therefore currenlty simply a list of providers that individuals can access.

An individual looking for a provider can go to this website and find a specific provider that they like, they can then click on them to see their information.

A provider can also go to this place on the website to either delete, or edit their information.

And finally, a new provider can go on this page and add themselves.

## Running the code:

- To run this on your local machine, you must simply type `flask run` in your terminal. 
- To open it in heroku, you can type `heroku open` in your terminal. 
- If you wish to run the tests, type `python3 tests.py` in your terminal.

## Code structure

- All the images are in a static file
- All the code is commented to explain what it should do
- Templates were used to create structure
- Basic bootstrap was used for the styling
